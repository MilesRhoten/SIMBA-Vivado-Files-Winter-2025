PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Kria_BD_i/motor_controller_0/inst/H_BR_DRV/pwm_gen/clk_div is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Kria_BD_i/motor_controller_0/inst/H_BR_DRV/pwm_gen/pwm_cntr_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell Kria_BD_i/motor_controller_0/inst/H_BR_DRV/pwm_gen/pwm_cntr_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
